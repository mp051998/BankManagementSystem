# BankManagementSystem
This is our 3rd sem ISA mini project for C++ Special Topic.

This Bank Management System program has all the basic features you would expect out of a bank management system and it has all been implemented using simple and easy to use c++ code.


In the program, to perform certain functions like creating a bank account, or withdrawing/depositing money, etc, which require administrator privileges in the real world, can be invoked only upon entering the password.
The password for this program is - compbank.
The given program is nothing but a mild interpretation of the heavily secure and complex banking systems of today.
Also one more function - account holder's list - this function can be used to display the account holders of the bank. No password is required here.
The list of header files used in our project is listed below.

1.	FSTREAM.H – for file handling, cin and cout
2.	CONIO.H – for clrscr() and getch() functions
3.	 STDIO.H – for standard I/O operations
4.	 STRING.H – for string handling 
5.	 IOSTREAM.H – For Standard I/O Operations

This program uses the concept of data file handling. In data file handling  data can be permanently stored in the computer. Using this we can store our data in Secondary memory (Hard disk). It has been made into a menu based program for the benefit of the user.
